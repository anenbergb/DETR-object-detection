Implementation of DETR: End-to-End Object Detection with Transformers


##  Positional Embeddings in Transformers
Transformers, by design, are permutation-invariant. This means they don't inherently understand the order of the input sequence. For tasks like natural language processing (NLP), where word order is crucial, or object detection, where spatial relationships matter, positional embeddings are essential.

Positional embeddings inject information about the position of elements in the sequence into the model. In DETR, they're used to encode the spatial coordinates of image patches, allowing the transformer to understand the relative positions of objects.

## Sine Positional Embeddings in DETR

DETR employs sine and cosine functions to generate positional embeddings. This approach offers several advantages:
* Relative Position Encoding: Sine and cosine functions allow the model to learn relative positional relationships rather than absolute positions.
* Extrapolation: The periodic nature of sine and cosine functions enables the model to generalize to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training.
* Frequency-Based Encoding: Using different frequencies for the sine and cosine functions provides a rich representation of positional information.

How They Work
1. Coordinate Normalization:
* DETR normalizes the spatial coordinates (x, y) of each image patch to the range [0, 1].
2. Frequency Generation:
* A set of frequencies is generated using a logarithmic scale. These frequencies determine the wavelengths of the sine and cosine functions.
3. Sine and Cosine Application:
* For each coordinate (x, y) and frequency, sine and cosine values are calculated.
4. Embedding Concatenation:
* The resulting sine and cosine values are concatenated to form the positional embedding vector.
